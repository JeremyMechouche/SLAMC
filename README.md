# SLAMC

This model describes SLA-aware reconfiguration strategies proposed in "Towards higher-level description of SLA-aware reconfiguration strategies based on state-machine". It is modelled using the eclipse modelling framework (EMF). It defines the structure of an SLA, its objectives and integrates reconfiguration strategies represented as state-machines.
